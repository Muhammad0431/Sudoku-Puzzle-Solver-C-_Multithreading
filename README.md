# Sudoku-Puzzle-Solver-C-_Multithreading

A Sudoku puzzle uses a 9 × 9 grid in which each column and
row, as well as each of the nine 3 × 3 sub grids, must contain all
the digits 1 ··· 9. Figure presents an example of a valid Sudoku
puzzle. This project consists of designing a multithreaded
application that determines whether the solution to a Sudoku
puzzle is valid. There are several different ways of
multithreading this application. One suggested strategy is to
create threads that check the following criteria:
 A thread to check that each column contains the digits 1
through 9
 A thread to check that each row contains the digits 1
through 9
 Nine threads to check that each of the 3 × 3 sub grids contains the digits 1
through 9 columns
